Hi, I'm Rohit and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Bath. I'm currently working as a Software Development Intern at SLB Cambridge Research Centre as part of the Well Technologies Group, currently focusing on improving safety and efficiency in automation & scheduling processes. I am also working on novel applications of Machine Learning to Computer Algebra Systems,with previous work focusing on improving the efficiency of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition.  

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
